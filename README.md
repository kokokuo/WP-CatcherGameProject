# Windows Phone Project - Catcher Game 

## Summary
A Catch game with firefighters in the background to save people. The game is a "side-scrolling game where players need to operate two firefighters with a hand-held safety net to catch people from the high-rise building who are not in a hurry to escape.

Sometimes, there will be some special effects props falling in the game, such as expanding the safety net, accelerating the movement, or reducing the speed of catching the net and slowing down.
